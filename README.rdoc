= App Store Pricing Matrix

A simple module that holds currencies and prices from the Apple's iOS App Store.

== Install

 gem install app_store_pricing_matrix

== Usage

Suppose you find a device locale by NSLocale on an iOS device.

 NSString* currency = [[NSLocale currentLocale] objectForKey:NSLocaleCurrencyCode];

That will give you the currency string like "USD" or "EUR", and this library expects them as a key.

Some constants, useful for validation:

 AppStorePricingMatrix::CUSTOMER_CURRENCIES
 => ["USD", "CAD", "MXN", "AUD", "NZD", "JPY", "EUR", "DKK", "SEK", "CHF", "NOK", "GBP"]

 AppStorePricingMatrix::DEVELOPER_CURRENCIES
 => ["USD", "CAD", "MXN", "AUD", "NZD", "JPY", "EUR", "CHF", "NOK", "GBP"]

To retrieve a customer price, query with the currency and the tier number:

 AppStorePricingMatrix::CUSTOMER_PRICES['USD'][1]
 => "0.99"

 AppStorePricingMatrix::CUSTOMER_PRICES['JPY'][1]
 => "85"

For developer proceeds:

 AppStorePricingMatrix::DEVELOPER_PROCEEDS['GBP'][30]
 => "12.78"

To retrieve a developer currency from a given customer currency:

 AppStorePricingMatrix::REVERSE_CURRENCY_MAP['SEK']
 => "EUR"
 
 AppStorePricingMatrix::REVERSE_CURRENCY_MAP['DKK']
 => "EUR"
